# OverEmote
Fork of OverEmote by SongZee. For now, this is mostly the original mod but made compatible with World of Warcraft v9.1

## Original CurseForge description
> Now you can thank your healers in World of Warcraft as well.  
> Over Emote brings the communications wheel in Overwatch to World of Warcraft.  
> Hold V to show it, select an emote, then release V.
> 
> Things still to ad:  
> - let users change the keybind  
> - let users change what each emote does
> 
> Enjoy!
